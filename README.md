### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Sam / tritoke (they/them)

I'm an avid programmer with an strong interest in cyber security.

I'm in the final year of my Computer Science degree @ The University of Manchester.

My final year project is looking at Password Authenticated Key Exchange(PAKE) algorithms.

I'm currently working to implement the AuCPace PAKE protocol in rust for [RustCrypto/PAKEs](https://github.com/RustCrypto/pakes).

#### I'm also interested in:
- Capture the flag competitions - I play regularly with [0rganizers](https://twitter.com/0rganizers),
  I mainly do misc challenges now because everyone on the team is too damn good ðŸ˜¤
  The only category I don't like is web :)
