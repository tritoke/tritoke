### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Sam / tritoke (he/they)

I'm an avid programmer with an strong interest in cyber security.

I'm a software engineer working on testing the safety of realtime Linux systems for automotive.

My final year project was looking at Password Authenticated Key Exchange(PAKE) algorithms:

I built an [aucpace implementation as part of it](https://github.com/RustCrypto/PAKEs/tree/master/aucpace).

#### I'm also interested in:
- Capture the flag competitions - I play regularly with [0rganizers](https://twitter.com/0rganizers),
  I mainly do misc challenges now because everyone on the team is too damn good ðŸ˜¤
  The only category I don't like is web :)
